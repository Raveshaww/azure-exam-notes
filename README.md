# Preface
Working through John Savill's DevOps Master Class and some additional material via Microsoft Learn

# Notes
### Foundation
- Things like patching OS and whatnot don't really bring value to the org, hence why they tend to be avoided in DevOps
- SCRUM always contains **only** pull motions
- SCRUM contains sprints, which are a fixed duration of work
- SCRUM can use kanban boards, but they assign points to each item of work
    - Instead of WIP limits, they use point limits
- Generally, team sizes do not pass what you can feed with 2 pizzas
- Kanban is always in motion
- Pull when you have space
- Self-service is key to agility
